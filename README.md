# Description
A quick & dirty script to emulate Raspberry family devices on your laptop.
It generates a valid sdcard image that can be deployed on real hardware and used as virtual storage for QEMU.

## Some features
* Preliminary support for custom images generated by third parties, adopting the classic Raspberry Pi partition table. 
* Use OVMF UEFI images for rpi-2 & rpi-3
* Almost full KVM acceleration for aarch64
* Latest stable Linux kernels for every supported platform
* Basic Networking support 
* Docker image and example docker-compose file for quick deploy
* SSH guest access

Powered with :heart: by Arch Linux Arm images

# Instructions
## Required runtime dependencies
* coreutils
* dnsmasq 
* dosfstools
* e2fsprogs  
* file  
* grep  
* iproute2 
* iptables 
* libarchive
* procps-ng 
* qemu-arch-extra 
* sudo
* util-linux 
* curl

## From sources
1. Download the sources and go into the simonpi directory
 
   ```git clone https://github.com/M0Rf30/simonpi.git```

   ```cd simonpi```

2. Set permissions for QEMU bridge interface
  
   ```sudo echo "allow rasp-br0 >> /etc/qemu/bridge.conf```

3. Download the required OVMF images:
    
   for rpi-2 (arch=ARM)

   http://snapshots.linaro.org/components/kernel/leg-virt-tianocore-edk2-upstream/latest/QEMU-ARM/RELEASE_GCC5/QEMU_EFI.fd

   for rpi-3 (arch=AARCH64)

   http://snapshots.linaro.org/components/kernel/leg-virt-tianocore-edk2-upstream/latest/QEMU-AARCH64/RELEASE_GCC5/QEMU_EFI.fd

   and place them respectively in the follow path:

   /usr/share/OVMF/$arch/QEMU_EFI.fd

4. Type:

   ```./simonpi -h for details```
    
and follow the help guidelines

## For Arch Linux users
You can find sim-on-pi on AUR

Type:

```yaourt -S simonpi-git```

and that's all!

## Docker image
See the **How to** into **docker** folder

# Deployment
All the assets (disk images, downloaded archives..) are saved in 
```~/.simonpi``` by default.

You can transfer your sd img on a valid sdcard using programs like Etcher or this simple command:

```dd if=sd-arch-MODEL-qemu.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M```

where MODEL could be:
* rpi
* rpi-2
* rpi-3

and X could be mmcblk0 or other block devices
